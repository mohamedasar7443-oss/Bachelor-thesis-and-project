# **Sentiment Analysis Project**
This project focuses on sentiment analysis using Classifier models. The objective is to classify US airlines sentiment reviews from as positive or negative or neutral based on their sentiment.

**Dataset**
The "Twitter Airline Sentiment" dataset is a collection of tweets from the social media platform- Twitter, where users express their sentiments and opinions about various airlines. To develop a machine learning or natural language processing (NLP) model that can accurately classify and analyze the sentiment expressed in tweets related to various airlines. The goal is to determine whether a tweet conveys a positive, neutral, or negative sentiment toward an airline and, in the case of negative sentiment, identify the specific reasons for the negativity (e.g., customer service issues, flight delays, lost luggage, etc.).
You can find the dataset in this repository from the dataset folder

**Dependencies**
To run the code and reproduce the results, you will need the following dependencies:

1) Python 3.x
2) Jupyter Notebook
3) scikit-learn library
4) NLTK library
5) xgboost model 
6) wordcloud
7) matplotlib library
8) seaborn library
9) Pandas library
10) Numpy library

You can install these dependencies by running the following command:

>pip install scikit-learn nltk xgboost wordcloud seaborn matplotlib pandas numpy

Running the Code:

To run the sentiment analysis code, follow these steps:

Download the twitter sentiment reviews dataset from the folder named dataset in the repository.

Install the required libraries using the command mentioned earlier.

Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells sequentially to import the necessary libraries, load the dataset, preprocess the data, build and train the model, and evaluate the model.

Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can use it to perform sentiment analysis on your own text data by calling the appropriate functions.

Additional Information
The notebook provides detailed explanations and comments to help you understand each step of the process.

You can experiment with different hyperparameters, preprocessing techniques, and model architectures to improve the performance of the sentiment analysis model.

The dataset contains a mix of positive and negative reviews, with labels assigned accordingly. The model learns from this labeled data to classify new reviews.

The README file will be updated as the project evolves and new features are added.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or encounter any issues while running the code.
